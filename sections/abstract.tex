This project introduces a novel approach to enhance security and user authentication in Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transactions by developing a robust model for real-time face visibility detection. The proposed system aims to identify instances where a person's face is covered or inadequately visible during ATM transactions, providing an additional layer of security and preventing potential unauthorized access.
\newline
\newline
The system leverages advanced computer vision techniques, utilizing deep learning algorithms to analyze live video feeds from ATM cameras. The model is trained on a diverse dataset to accurately recognize variations in facial visibility caused by factors such as clothing, accessories, and lighting conditions. By employing state-of-the-art image processing and facial recognition technologies, the system can promptly assess whether a user's face is covered or not, ensuring a reliable authentication process.
\newline
\newline
Upon detection of insufficient face visibility, the system triggers a notification mechanism, alerting relevant authorities or the account holder to the potential security threat. This proactive approach enhances user safety and mitigates the risk of fraudulent transactions or unauthorized access to ATM services.
