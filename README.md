# Mini Project Report

This repository contains a LaTeX template for a mini project report. The template provides a structured format for documenting the key aspects of a project, including the introduction, objectives, methodology, results, conclusion, references, and acknowledgements. It also includes a placeholder for an image, which is currently set to display a logo from the `images` directory.

## How to Use

### Working Locally

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `README.md` file in your preferred text editor or IDE.
3. Replace the placeholder text in each section with the relevant content for your project.
4. If you're using version control, commit your changes and push them to your repository to keep track of your progress.
5. To generate a PDF of your report, you'll need to compile the LaTeX source code. This can be done using a LaTeX distribution such as TeX Live or MiKTeX.

### Working on Overleaf

1. Create a new project on Overleaf.
2. Upload the contents of this repository to your Overleaf project.
3. Edit the `README.md` file directly in the Overleaf editor, replacing the placeholder text in each section with the relevant content for your project.
4. Remember to replace the image link with the correct path to your image, as the file structure on Overleaf may be different from your local setup.
5. Once you're done, you can compile the project on Overleaf to generate a PDF of your report.
